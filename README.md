It is a smart IOT solar panel that allows user to attain maximum sunlight exposure throughout the day and store the energy for later use. 

Components of the project:
- LDR sensor - constantly recognize the birghtest part of the sky. 
- Servo motor - move the arm of the solar panel.
- Arduino microcontroller - core of the project.
- Blynk app 
  - App that allows user to manually control the direction of the solar panel facing to. 
  - Allow voice control, with integration of Google Voice API. 
  - Display total energy accumulated.
- Power Bank - where the light energy is stored
