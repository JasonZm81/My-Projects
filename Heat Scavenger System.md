# Heat_Scavenger_System
Heat Scavenger System is a device that able to harvest heat energy that dissipated out as by-product heat. It is known to us that there are always excess heat energy that howvering around our air that left unattended. But do you know that heat energy actually can be recycled and re-used to generate electricity, again ?
This project studied the effective desgin of a heat harvesting energy system. Experiments were carried out to identify environment that has the highest by-product heat dissipation, to deduce a effective design in capturing and releasing of the heat and to alter the heat energy to electric energy and stored for usage.

To our fndings, we chosen the heat dessipated from air conditioner's condenser as our experiment. Hot air was blown out from air con condenser, the heat was trapped in the air. Thus, in our final desgin, a propeller/fan type casing design was implemented in order to let our thermoelectric devices acquire the maximum heat exposure. The thermoelectric device that we used was thermoelectric power generator (TEG), also called a Seebeck generator, is a solid state device that converts heat flux (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect (a form of thermoelectric effect). Simply saying, the design able to exibit well heat energy collection and heat energy disspitation with heat sink design, therefore it fullfiled the equation of Seeback effect and we able to harness electricity generated from different temperature.

As the electricity from the heat energy is unstable, we have make a voltage regulator circuitry to ensure a smooth flow of current to our power accumulator.  
To our succeed, we managed to recycle and reuse the excess heat energy and stored into a power bank for normal usage.
